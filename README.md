1. First, make sure you have Xampp installed on your machine. If not, download and install it.
2. Create a folder inside the `htdocs` directory of your Xampp installation. You can name it whatever you like.
3. Clone this repository into the folder you created, replacing the name of the directory with the one you chose in the previous step.
4. Start the MySQL server and Apache in Xampp.
5. Create a new database in your MySQL server.
6. Import the `users.sql` file into the newly created database.
7. Open the `connection.php` file and change the database name to match the one you created in step 5.
8. By default, the username is `root` and the password field should be left empty.
9. Once you have completed the above steps, you can run the Apache Server and MySQL server in Xampp and navigate to `localhost/your-folder-name` in your browser to view the website.
